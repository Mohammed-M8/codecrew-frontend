# Code Crew
## Overview
CodeCrew is a web-based platform where like-minded coders can lookup interesting projects that may require contributors or create a project idea and request members to help in bringing the project to life. This platform allows beginners to learn collaboration and trade skills with each other while also providing startup creatives to allow experienced developers provide help in the creation of their unique ideas.
